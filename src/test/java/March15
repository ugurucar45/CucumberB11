Scenario Outline/Templates: is a way to run the same test scenario with the different set of data.
                            -->TestNg-->Data Provider
                            -->Cucumber-Junit-->Scenario Outline
Note:* Scenario Outline must have Examples table
Note2*:To be able to connect examples table with the parameters in feature file. We put diamond bracket.
Exceptions:
-->FeatureParserException: it means you have a synthax issue in your feature file (feature keyword is missing ":")
-->NoSuchElementException: it means you need to check your xpath.(or check your previous step and watch what is going on with your codes)
    *Check Iframe
    *Check windowhandle
    *If it is not on the view (it means go and scrooldown)
    *You can also put thread.sleep
-->NullPointerException : either I didn't initiliaze the driver or page class etc.
                        *I need to check my driver where it is pointing or initiliazed or not
                        *I need to check my pages are initiliazed.
-->StaleElementException:You get this exception once your element/page is disappeared,refreshed,updated....etc
*Thread.sleep(2000)
*Initiliaze the webelement or page one more time to load your driver with specified elements
--> TimeOutException==>When we use explicity wait, it will throw the timeoutexception if it can not find the element within given time.
   Note:I would definitely check the xpath of the element.
-->ElementIsNotInteractableException-->you are trying to click the element is not clickable.
  Note: I would try different click methods (like JS).(and the elements has "a" tag or go above or below the path.)
FAQ:
  1)I am running my feature file but it is not running at all.
  -Driver not initiliazed(check your hook class)
  -Feature file path might be wrong(check your feature path and glue path)
  -Unimplemented step
  -Make sure dry run is false
  2)I am running feature file even though I implemented the steps still getting unimplemented steps exception?
  -Check file path for specifically glue
  -Check your whole synthax of steps
  3)I implemented the step but cucumber feature file still has yellow highlighted.
  -Make sure text in feature file step is same with the text in step definition class.
  4) I use  the ConfigReader to read some properties from properties file, it is giving me configreader property cannot be null.(error)
  DATA TABLE:
    is table with data to pass for a specific step.It is like Parameters in TESTNG
    *We can use data table to store our multiple data in good format. We can store our data as list, as map
