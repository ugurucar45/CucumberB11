   Tags--> I need to use tags keyword under the Cucumber options to be able to filtrate my scenarios.
    *Tags must be inside of the feature file
    *Tags can be anywhere you want.(above feature, above scenario, above Background,above Scenario Outline)
    *We have a different version of the tags:
    "@regression" ,
    "@regression and @smoke",
    "@regression or @special",
    "@special and @regression and not @smoke"
    Scenario Outline/Template: it is a way to execute same scenario with the different set of data multiple times.You must have examples keyword once you use Scenario Outline.
    *To be able to connect your scenario outline data with examples data.WE USE DIAMOND FOR THE VALUES(parameters)
      Examples:
      |username|Password |
      |ahmet   | ahmet123|
      |mehmet  |mehmet123|
